# DAY 3: Abstract Classes, Interfaces & Inheritance

Today, you'll dive deeper into object-oriented programming by learning about abstract classes, interfaces, multiple inheritance, and the use of `this` and `super` keywords. These concepts help you build flexible and reusable code.

## Teacher's Instructions & Topic Guide

1. **Abstract Classes**
	- Abstract classes allow you to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, as well as methods with default behavior.
2. **Interfaces**
	- Interfaces define a contract for classes. A class can implement multiple interfaces, enabling multiple inheritance of type.
3. **Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces)**
	- Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes, but you can achieve it using interfaces.
4. **`this` and `super` Keywords**
	- `this` refers to the current object, while `super` refers to the parent class. Use them to access variables and methods.

## Learning Path & Example Files

- [`abstract1.java`](abstract1.java): See how to implement abstract classes and methods.
- [`InterfaceEx.java`](InterfaceEx.java): Learn how to define and implement interfaces.
- [`MultipleInher.java`](MultipleInher.java): Practice multiple inheritance using interfaces.
- [`SuperDemo.java`](SuperDemo.java): Explore the use of `super` to access parent class members.
- [`ThisMethod.java`](ThisMethod.java): Understand method invocation using `this`.
- [`ThisRefExample.java`](ThisRefExample.java): See how `this` is used in constructors.

## How to Run

Open any `.java` file and run using:

```sh
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

## Key Concepts

- Interfaces
- Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces)
- `this` and `super` keywords
