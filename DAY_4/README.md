# DAY 4: Inheritance, Overloading & Overriding

Today, you'll learn about inheritance, method overloading, method overriding, and the use of the `this` keyword in Java. These concepts help you build flexible, reusable, and maintainable code.

## Teacher's Instructions & Topic Guide

    - Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another. Use it to avoid code duplication and promote reuse.
    - Constructors can be inherited and called using `super`. See how child classes initialize parent class members.
    - Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. It helps make your code more readable and flexible.
    - Overriding lets you change the behavior of a parent class method in a child class. Use `@Override` to indicate this.
    - `this` refers to the current object. Use it to distinguish between instance variables and parameters, or to call other constructors.

1. **Inheritance**
   - Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another. Use it to avoid code duplication and promote reuse.
2. **Constructor Inheritance**
   - Constructors can be inherited and called using `super`. See how child classes initialize parent class members.
3. **Method Overloading**
   - Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. It helps make your code more readable and flexible.
4. **Method Overriding**
   - Overriding lets you change the behavior of a parent class method in a child class. Use `@Override` to indicate this.
5. **`this` Keyword**
   - `this` refers to the current object. Use it to distinguish between instance variables and parameters, or to call other constructors.

## Learning Path & Example Files

- [`ConsInher.java`](ConsInher.java): Demonstrates constructor inheritance and use of `super`.
- [`Maruti800.java`](Maruti800.java): Example of class inheritance and method overriding.
- [`MethodOverload.java`](MethodOverload.java): Shows method overloading with different parameter types.
- [`MethodOverride.java`](MethodOverride.java): Demonstrates method overriding with multiple classes.
- [`ThisConst.java`](ThisConst.java): Usage of `this` in constructors and methods.

## How to Run

Open any `.java` file and run using:

    javac FileName.java
    java FileName

## Key Concepts

- Inheritance
- Constructor Inheritance
- Method Overloading
- Method Overriding
- Use of `this` keyword
