# DAY 2: Java Fundamentals & Abstract Classes

Today, you'll learn about Java's default values, command-line arguments, and the powerful concept of abstract classes. Abstract classes help you define a blueprint for other classes, and are a key part of object-oriented programming.

## Teacher's Instructions & Topic Guide

1. **Default Values**
	- Every variable in Java has a default value if not initialized. See how different types behave in the examples.
2. **Command-line Arguments**
	- Java programs can accept input from the command line. Practice passing arguments and using them in your code.
3. **Abstract Classes**
	- Abstract classes can have both abstract (no body) and non-abstract methods. You cannot create objects of abstract classes directly; you must inherit them.
	- Use the examples to see how abstract classes are implemented and extended.

## Learning Path & Example Files

- [`abs1.java`](abs1.java): Shows how to implement and extend an abstract class.
- [`DefaultValues.java`](DefaultValues.java): Explore default values for Java primitive types.
- [`Test.java`](Test.java): Practice using command-line arguments.
- [`TotalAndAvgMarks.java`](TotalAndAvgMarks.java): Calculate total and average marks using command-line input.

### Assignment_2/

- [`AbstractExample.java`](Assignment_2/AbstractExample.java): Abstract class with multiple shapes. Try adding your own shape!
- [`MethodInvoke.java`](Assignment_2/MethodInvoke.java): Learn about method invocation.
- [`StaticDemo.java`](Assignment_2/StaticDemo.java): See the difference between static and instance variables.

## How to Run

Open any `.java` file and run using:

```sh
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

## Key Concepts

- Abstract Classes
- Default Values
- Command-line Arguments
- Static vs Instance Variables

Read the explanations above, then open and run the code files. Try modifying the examples and see how abstract classes and command-line arguments work in practice!
