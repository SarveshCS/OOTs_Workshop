# DAY 1: Introduction to Java & Encapsulation

Welcome to your first day of Java! Today, you'll learn about the basics of Java programming and the concept of encapsulation. Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that helps you organize and protect your code.

## Teacher's Instructions & Topic Guide

1. **What is Encapsulation?**
	- Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit called a class.
	- It helps keep your data safe from outside interference and misuse.
	- Example: Think of a class as a capsule that contains both the medicine (data) and instructions (methods) for using it.

2. **Java Basics**
	- Learn how to write your first Java program, take user input, and work with variables and arrays.
	- Practice by running and modifying the example files below.

## Learning Path & Example Files

Explore the following files in the `Basics/` folder:

- [`HelloWorld.java`](Basics/HelloWorld.java): Take user input and print it. Try changing the prompt or output!
- [`Main.java`](Basics/Main.java): See how to declare variables and use arrays. Experiment with different values.
- [`program_1.java`](Basics/program_1.java): Another example of input/output. Try adding more questions for the user.

## How to Run

Open any `.java` file in the Basics folder and run using:

```sh
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

## Key Concepts

- Encapsulation
- Input/Output
- Variables and Arrays
