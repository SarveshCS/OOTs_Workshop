# Object Oriented Techniques (OOTs) — Workshop Code

This repository contains the Java code I wrote during the Object Oriented Techniques (OOTs) workshops.
The exercises and examples are organized by day and kept in sequence as the days pass.

## Structure

- `DAY_1`, `DAY_2`, ... — folders with the code and notes for each workshop day.
- `archive/` — older examples and extra material.

## Notes

- Each day folder has its own `README.md` with details for that day's exercises.
- Keep changes simple and incremental so the code follows the workshop order.

Feel free to open the day folders to explore the examples.
